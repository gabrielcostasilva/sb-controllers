# @Controller Examples
Projects in this repo are mainly based on [Josh Long's series on Spring @Controllers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhNGqTwsGw0).

## Overview of Projects
Each folder groups a single example as follows:

- [_websockets_](./websockets/) exemplifies how WebSocket can enable two-way communication in real-time applications.

- [_rsocket_](./rsocket/) shows a RSocket implementation for request-response and request-stream interactions.

- [_graphql_](./graphql/) introduces the Spring support for GraphQL.

- [_mvc_](./mvc/) uses traditional MVC model-2 architecture and error handling with Spring MVC.
